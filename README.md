Endless Runner Game made with Unity Engine and C#

Download the executable content including the data folder with all the needed files to execute the game. 

GOAL: Collect as many gems as possible. Current local record score is stored and displayed and thats the one to beat.  

Enjoy! 

NOTE: This is a very old project made with a colleague during our technical programming course/Foudantion degree in software engineering. 
Considering the mentioned context, we were learning how to code and not very aware of clean programming and good practises to consider. That being said, please ignore the lack of files management and folder organization.
